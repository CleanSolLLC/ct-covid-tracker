# About CT-Covid-Tracker

This is a Rails application that allows users to research Connecticut COVID-19 data at the state, county and town level. The user can also research data based on gender, race/etnicity and age group.

Data is accessed via the State of Connecticut COVID-19 Data portal https://data.ct.gov/browse?tags=covid-19 using the Socrata Open Data API (SODA) https://dev.socrata.com/. The application utilizes the Soda-Ruby gem to access data through api endpoints and allows for the writing of SQL-like statements to return values from various datasets. Please read the notes.md file for more information on the datasets and the models used in this application. An entity relationship diagram is also provided (erd.pdf).

### Note that the data is cumulative and depending on breaks in time periods in between queries it may be worthwhile to delete data and rerun queries to interpret the graph results. 


The user will have the ability to:

* Create/delete their own account and sign in and out of their own account with a username and password.
* Sign in to their own account using their Google login credentials.
* Input dates and other input parameters to run queries within various State of Connecticut COVID-19 datasets.
* View line charts that are dynamically created based on the values returned by the dataset queried.
* Create, edit, and delete posts that can be read by other users.
* Comment on posts written by other users.
* Create, view, edit or delete data from their own account.
